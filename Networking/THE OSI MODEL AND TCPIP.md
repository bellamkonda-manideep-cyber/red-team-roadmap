# ISO/OSI Model :-

## LAYER 7 - APPLICATION LAYER
• What it does: Where applications (browsers, email) access network services. </br>
• Real-world examples: HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP. </br>
• Simple analogy: The "language" your application speaks. </br>

## LAYER 6 - PRESENTATION LAYER
• What it does: Translation, encryption, compression of data. </br>
• Real-world examples: SSL/TLS, JPEG, MPEG. </br>
• Simple analogy: The "translator" that makes data understandable. </br>

## LAYER 5 - SESSION LAYER
• What it does: Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections. </br>
• Real-world examples: NetBIOS, RPC. </br>
• Simple analogy: The "phone call manager". </br>

## LAYER 4 - TRANSPORT LAYER
• What it does: End-to-end connection, reliability, flow control. </br>
• Real-world examples: TCP, UDP. </br>
• Simple analogy: The "postal service" that ensures delivery. </br>

## LAYER 3 - NETWORK LAYER
• What it does: Logical addressing and routing between networks. </br>
• Real-world examples: IP, ICMP, routers. </br>
• Simple analogy: The "GPS navigation system". </br>

## LAYER 2 - DATA LINK LAYER
• What it does: Physical addressing, error detection on same network. </br>
• Real-world examples: MAC addresses, switches, Ethernet. </br>
• Simple analogy: The "local street addresses". </br>

## LAYER 1 - PHYSICAL LAYER
• What it does: Physical connection - cables, electrical signals. </br>
• Real-world examples: Ethernet cables, WiFi radio waves. </br>
• Simple analogy: The "roads and highways". </br>

# TCP/IP :-

## APPLICATION LAYER (OSI L5-L7)
• Combines: Application, Presentation, Session layers. </br>
• Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS, SMTP. </br>

## TRANSPORT LAYER (OSI L4)
• Same as OSI: TCP, UDP. </br>
• Function: Reliable data delivery. </br>

## INTERNET LAYER (OSI L3)
• Same as OSI: IP, ICMP. </br>
• Function: Routing across networks. </br>

## NETWORK ACCESS LAYER (OSI L1-L2)
• Combines: Physical and Data Link layers. </br>
• Technologies: Ethernet, WiFi, MAC addresses. </br>

# RED TEAMER PERSPECTIVE
Why this matters for your goal:

Reconnaissance: Understanding layers tells you where to look for information

Attack Planning: Different attacks target different layers

Troubleshooting: When an attack fails, you know which layer to investigate

Evasion: Understanding how traffic flows helps you hide your activities



## Questions and Answers :-

1."Which OSI layers do red teamers interact with most?"

Layers 2-4 & 7 are our primary playground:

Layer 2 (Data Link): ARP spoofing, MAC flooding attacks

Layer 3 (Network): IP spoofing, routing attacks, ping sweeps

Layer 4 (Transport): Port scanning, SYN floods, connection hijacking

Layer 7 (Application): Web app attacks, API exploitation, phishing

</br>
2."Which layers does Nmap operate at?"

Primarily Layers 3 & 4, but can touch all layers:

Layer 3: IP discovery, network mapping

Layer 4: TCP/UDP port scanning (SYN, ACK, UDP scans)

Layer 7: Service version detection, OS fingerprinting
